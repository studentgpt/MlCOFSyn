MlCOFSyn is a machine learning framework designed for the synthesis of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs). MlCOFSyn leverages machine learning algorithms and features an intuitive graphical interface, enabling it to be run on consumer-grade computers by non-experts. The MlCOFSyn framework currently integrates the NEgen1o model as the computational engine and has the following functionalities:

1. ‚Äã**Prediction**‚Äã: Predicts the crystal size based on the input monomer addition sequence.
2. ‚Äã**Design**‚Äã: Derives the required monomer addition sequence by specifying the target crystal size.
3. ‚Äã**Optimization**‚Äã: Optimizes the synthesis pathway to produce larger crystals.

## Installation
1.You can clone the repository by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/studentgpt/MlCOFSyn.git
```

2.install environment requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`C++>= 8.1.0`


## Instructions for running MlCOFSyn


### **1.Prediction Task**
**1.1 Run the following command to launch the the NEgen1o Graphical User Interface(GUI):** 
```bash
python NEgen1_start.py
```


**After starting up the GUI:**

- The **left panel** (Initial System and Preparation Condition) is used to **initialize parameters**. This section allows you to set the initial conditions for the system, such as volume, concentration, and other system-related settings.

- The **right panel** is for **generating addition lists**. Here, you can create sequences for adding monomers or other materials during the reaction process.

To modify the **internal parameters** of different COFs (which are obtained through experimental measurements and reaction pathway analysis), click on the **`Load COF parameters`** button. This allows you to adjust various COF-related settings based on the data you have.

Additionally, by clicking on the options in the list, you can generate different types of **monomer addition lists**, which can be used to guide the experimental procedure based on the sequence type (e.g., constant sequence, geometric progression, etc.).

**1.2 Enter the monomer addition sequence in the "NEgen1oOutput" section to obtain the final output result.**

In this section, you will need to input the **monomer addition sequence** to generate the results. The sequence can be entered in the following format:

* `0.019,0.037,0.055,0.073,0.091,0.109,0.127,0.145,0.163,0.181` represents increasing-rate addition

* `1`represents a single addition

**1.3 Finally, click `Output` in the "DataProcessing" section to view all the corresponding results, including detailed data and crystal distribution.**

### **2.Optimization Task**

**2.1 Run the following command to launch the Bayesian optimization interface:**
   ```bash
   python main_ui_optimization.py
   ```

**2.2** After launching the program, enter the **initial parameters** and click **`Set COF parameters`** to set up the COF parameters.

**2.3** Then, click **`Start`** to enter the **Bayesian Optimization GUI**. Input the required **reaction space** CSV file path, **Total Iteration**, **termination conditions**, and **candidates per iteration**, and click **"Start Bayesian Optimization"** to begin the process.
 
üö® **Recommended to use 5 experiments per batch, and the number of CPU cores should be at least 6.** üö®

### **3.Design Task**
**3.1 Run the following command to launch the Bayesian Design GUI:**
```bash
python main_ui_design.py
   ```
**3.2** After launching the program, enter the **initial parameters** and click **`Set COF parameters`** to set up the COF parameters.

**3.3** Then, click **`Start`** to enter the **Bayesian Design GUI**. Input the required **reaction space** CSV file path, **Total Iteration**, **termination conditions**, and **candidates per iteration**, and click **"Start Bayesian Design"** to begin the process.
 
üö® **Recommended to use 5 experiments per batch, and the number of CPU cores should be at least 6.** üö®

   **Please verify the number of tasks and cores before submission to avoid system overload.**

## A brief description of the theory

The NEgen1 model<sup>[1]</sup> was derived from kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results. This model takes six parameters for the 2D COF and those for COF-5 are used as default as provided in the code.<sup>[1][2]</sup>Methods to derive the parameters for the other 2D COFs can be found in literature.<sup>[3][4]</sup> The NEgen1o model is optimized upon the NEgen1 model for efficiency while not affecting accuracy.<sup>[5]</sup>

The prediction task is performed by directly running the computational engine (the NEgen1o model). The optimization task leverages Bayesian algorithm.<sup>[6]</sup> The design task utilize the MeanBAX<sup>[7]</sup> as the acquisition function.
