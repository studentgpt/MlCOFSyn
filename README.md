MlCOFSyn is a machine learning framework designed for the synthesis of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs). MlCOFSyn leverages machine learning algorithms and features an intuitive graphical interface, enabling it to be run on consumer-grade computers by non-experts. The MlCOFSyn framework currently integrates the NEgen1o model as the computational engine and has the following functionalities:

1. ‚Äã**Prediction**‚Äã: Predicts the crystal size based on the input monomer addition sequence.
2. ‚Äã**Design**‚Äã: Derives the required monomer addition sequence by specifying the target crystal size.
3. ‚Äã**Optimization**‚Äã: Optimizes the monomer addition sequence to produce larger crystals.

## Instructions for running MlCOFSyn


### **1.Prediction Task**
**1.1 Run the following command to launch the the NEgen1o Graphical User Interface(GUI):** 
```bash
cd MlCOFSyn\prediction
```
```bash
python NEgen1_start.py
```


**After starting up the GUI:**

- **`Set COF Parameters`** Button: Click this button to adjust the material parameters of the 2D COF, which can be determined through experimental measurements and reaction pathway analysis.

- The **Initial System**: This section enables you to define the initial conditions of the system, such as the initial volume, initial nuclei concentration, diameter, and height.

- The **Conditions to Add Monomer**: In this section, you are required to input the **Monomer (core) Concentration** first, followed by the **Monomer Addition Sequence**, which is a list of the monomer volume added at each time (in L). Once the **Monomer Addition Sequence** is entered, you may click the `Check Input` button to display the corresponding **Number of Additions** and the **Total Added Volume**.

The monomer addition sequence can be entered in the following format:

* `0.019,0.037,0.055,0.073,0.091,0.109,0.127,0.145,0.163,0.181` represents increasing-rate addition

* `1` represents a single addition

**1.2  `Run Computational Engine` section:**

In this section, you can initiate the calculation by clicking the `Run` button to execute the NEgen1o model. Once the model starts running, you can view detailed computational information directly from the panel in real-time.

![image3](https://github.com/studentgpt/test1/blob/main/image/NEgen1o_3.png)

üö® **Before performing the next addition sequence calculation with the same number of additions, please ensure that all addition sequence files with the same number of additions (e.g., `nuc__1_0_x`, where `x`is identical) in the `MlCOFSyn\negen1o` directory are first backed up to another folder or deleted. Otherwise, the program will not run when you click `Start`**

**1.3 Finally, click `Get Result Summary` in the "Post Processing" section to view all the corresponding results, including detailed data and crystal distribution.**

### **2.Optimization Task**

**2.1 Run the following command to launch the Bayesian optimization interface:**
   ```bash
   cd MlCOFSyn\optimization
   ```
   ```bash
   python main_ui_optimization.py
   ```

**2.2** After launching the program, you will enter the **Bayesian Optimization GUI**. To proceed, first click **`Set COF parameters`** to configure the COF parameters, and then input the **Monomer Concentration**.

**2.3** After entering the initial parameters, follow these steps to begin the Bayesian optimization process:

  1. **Load Monomer Addition Sequence Space File**:  
     Upload the file containing the monomer addition sequence space to be optimized.
     The reaction space must be in CSV format with the following structure:
  ```bash
     r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9,r10,r11,r12,r13,r14,r15,r16,r17,r18,r19,r20
  
     0.062,0.109,0.082,0.025,0.165,0.147,0.131,0.146,0.102,0.031,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
  
     0.031,0.036,0.07,0.054,0.021,0.086,0.027,0.012,0.092,0.013,0.089,0.075,0.028,0.028,0.088,0.071,0.076,0.019,0.022,0.062

   ```
  - The first row contains feature names.
  - The following rows represent monomer addition sequences.
  - You can find data examples in the file: `MlCOFSyn\optimization\space\all_space.csv`
  - To ensure the proper functioning of the surrogate model, **please make sure that all monomer addition sequences in the `reaction_space.csv` have the same number of features** (use `0` to fill any empty spaces).
  
  2. **Stop Conditions**:  
     - Input the **Maximum Number of Iterations**.  
     - Specify the **No-Improvement Criterion** as a stop condition.  
  
  3. **Start the Optimization**:  
     Once the **monomer addition sequence space file** and **stop conditions** are confirmed, click the **`Start Bayesian Optimization`** button to initiate the process.

The **Maximum Q value** and its corresponding **monomer addition sequence** will be displayed on the interface, and all other results will be saved to `optimization/result.csv`.
 
üö® **Recommended to use 5 experiments per batch, and the number of CPU cores should be at least 6.** üö®

## A brief description of the theory

The NEgen1 model<sup>[1]</sup> was derived from kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results. This model takes six parameters for the 2D COF and those for COF-5 are used as default as provided in the code.<sup>[1][2]</sup>Methods to derive the parameters for the other 2D COFs can be found in literature.<sup>[3][4]</sup> The NEgen1o model is optimized upon the NEgen1 model for efficiency while not affecting accuracy.<sup>[5]</sup>

The prediction task is performed by directly running the computational engine (the NEgen1o model). The optimization task leverages Bayesian algorithm.<sup>[6]</sup> The design task utilize the MeanBAX<sup>[7]</sup> as the acquisition function.
